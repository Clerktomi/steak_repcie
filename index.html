                    <p class="text-white szoveg">I love the kind of dinner you can whip up without relying on a recipe. Truth be told, good cooking is more about mastering techniques than following recipes, and the best dishes are often the simplest to make. A perfectly cooked steak is a prime example. With just a handful of ingredients and a single pan, you can prepare a steak that rivals anything you’d enjoy at a high-end steakhouse.</p>

                    <p class="text-white szoveg">The secret is mastering the art of pan-searing. This classic technique involves cooking the surface of your food undisturbed in a piping hot pan until a crisp, golden-brown, and flavorful crust forms. It’s the key to building flavor and texture in a dish <span class="bold">while preventing sticking and giving your meal a restaurant-quality</span> appearance. Pan-searing is hands-down the best way to cook a steak  (it works wonders for salmon and scallops, too), and it also happens to be incredibly easy.</p>

                    <p class="text-white szoveg">When it comes to beef, the best candidates for pan-searing are boneless, quick-cooking cuts between one and one-and-a-half inches thick, such as NY Strip, rib eye or filet mignon. (For larger or slow-cooking cuts, like <span class="emel">beef tenderloin with red wine</span> sauce or beef stew with carrots and potatoes, pan-searing is usually the first step, and then you finish the cooking in the oven.)</p>

                    <p class="text-white szoveg">To begin, pat the steak dry with paper towels. (Any moisture on the exterior of the steak must first evaporate before the meat begins to brown.) Season the steaks generously on both sides with salt and pepper; the seasoning will stick to the surface and help create a delicious crust.</p>
